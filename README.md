# Curiosity UI

This project is also created for unit test practice with Jasmine.

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`

And try to fix, add and cover more unit test!

## Note

At Angular 15, `karma.conf.js` is not automatically generated. Run the command below

```
npx ng g config karma
```

And add `codeCoverage: true` in **angular.json** > **projects** > **<app_name>** > **architect** > **test** > **options**
